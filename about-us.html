          <h2>About Workout Tracker</h2>

          <p>
            Workout Tracker is a minimalist, privacy-focused fitness application
            designed for individuals who want to take control of their strength
            training journey without compromising their personal data.
          </p>

          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            We believe that tracking your fitness progress should be simple,
            effective, and private. That's why we created an application that
            runs entirely in your browser, storing all your data locally on your
            device. No accounts, no servers, no tracking—just you and your
            workout data.
          </p>

          <h3>How to Use</h3>
          <p>
            Getting started with Workout Tracker is simple. Follow these steps
            to begin tracking your fitness journey:
          </p>

          <div class="feature-card" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
            <h4>1. Build Your Exercise Library</h4>
            <p>
              Start by going to the <strong>Library</strong> tab and clicking
              <strong>"New Exercise"</strong>. Add your favorite exercises with
              optional notes for form cues, equipment settings, or personal
              bests. You can also add <strong>tags</strong> to your exercises to
              easily filter and organize them by muscle group or equipment.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
            <h4>2. Create Workout Presets</h4>
            <p>
              Navigate to the <strong>Presets</strong> tab and click
              <strong>"New Preset"</strong>. Select exercises from your library
              and give your routine a name (e.g., "Push Day", "Leg Day", "Upper
              Body"). Presets make it quick and easy to start tracking your
              regular workout routines with a single click.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
            <h4>3. Track Your Workouts</h4>
            <p>
              Go to the <strong>Workouts</strong> tab and click
              <strong>"Track Workout"</strong>. Select a preset or create a
              custom workout. You can log each set with weight and reps, and
              classify them as
              <strong>warm-up (W), normal (N), or failure (F)</strong>. You can
              also track <strong>cardio</strong> sessions with duration and
              type.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
            <h4>4. Use the Rest Timer</h4>
            <p>
              Switch to the <strong>Timer</strong> tab during your workout. Use
              quick-set intervals (30s, 1m, 1m 30s, 2m, 3m) or enter a custom
              duration. The timer helps you maintain consistent rest periods,
              which is crucial for progressive overload and recovery.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
            <h4>5. Manage Your Data</h4>
            <p>
              Use the <strong>Export</strong> button to download your entire
              workout history and library as a JSON backup file. Use
              <strong>Import</strong> to restore data from a previous export or
              sync your progress between different devices.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Install as an App (Mobile)</h3>

            install it directly on your phone for a native app experience:

          <h3>Why Choose Workout Tracker?</h3>
          <p>
            Most fitness apps today are bloated with social features, require
            expensive subscriptions, and harvest your personal data. Workout
            Tracker is different:

            to send your data to. It's yours, and it stays with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>• Lightweight:</strong> Built with vanilla JavaScript for
            maximum speed and minimal battery drain.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>• Ownership:</strong> Easily export your data to JSON
            anytime for your own records or analysis.
          </p>
