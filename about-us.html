          <h2>About Workout Tracker</h2>

          <p>
            Workout Tracker is a minimalist, privacy-focused fitness application
            designed for individuals who want to take control of their strength
            training journey without compromising their personal data.
          </p>

          <h3>Why I Built This</h3>
          <p>
            Honestly? Frustration. I looked around at the available workout
            tracking apps and kept running into the same problems — bloated
            interfaces, paywalls for basic features, mandatory accounts, and
            apps that felt like they were designed to sell you something rather
            than help you train.
          </p>
          <p>
            All I wanted was something free, simple, and straight to the point.
            Something I could open, log my workout, and close. No distractions,
            no subscriptions, no data being harvested. Since that app didn't
            seem to exist, I built it myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            And once it was working well for me, I thought — why not share it
            with the world? So here it is. Enjoy!
          </p>

          <h3>How to Use</h3>
          <p>
            Getting started with Workout Tracker is simple. Follow these steps
            to begin tracking your fitness journey:
          </p>

          <div class="feature-card" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
            <h4>1. Build Your Exercise Library</h4>
            <p>
              Start by going to the <strong>Library</strong> tab and clicking
              <strong>"New Exercise"</strong>. Add your favorite exercises with
              structured detail fields for <strong>last weight used</strong>,
              <strong>personal record (PR)</strong>,
              <strong>warm-up weight</strong>, and
              <strong>set specification</strong>, plus a free-text field for
              form and execution notes. You can also add
              <strong>tags</strong> to organize exercises by muscle group or
              equipment for quick filtering.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
            <h4>2. Create Workout Presets</h4>
            <p>
              Navigate to the <strong>Presets</strong> tab and click
              <strong>"New Preset"</strong>. Use the built-in search to quickly
              find and select exercises from your library, then give your
              routine a name (e.g., "Push Day", "Leg Day", "Upper Body").
              Presets make it quick and easy to start tracking your regular
              workout routines with a single click.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
            <h4>3. Track Your Workouts</h4>
            <p>
              Go to the <strong>Workouts</strong> tab and click
              <strong>"Track Workout"</strong>. Select a preset or create a
              custom workout. Log each set with weight and reps, and classify
              them as <strong>warm-up, normal, or failure</strong>. Tap any
              <strong>exercise name</strong> to instantly open its detail panel
              — showing your last weight, PR, warm-up weight, set spec, and form
              notes — without leaving the workout. When you finish a set, tap
              the <strong>"✓ Rest"</strong> button to instantly start your rest
              timer. You can also track <strong>cardio</strong> sessions with
              duration and type.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
            <h4>4. Use the Rest Timer</h4>
            <p>
              A rest timer is available in two ways. During a workout, tap
              <strong>"⏱ Rest Timer"</strong> at the top of the workout view — a
              floating panel slides in from the bottom-right with a circular
              countdown, preset durations (1m, 90s, 2m, 3m, 5m), and a custom
              input. Your preferred duration is remembered between sessions. You
              can also access the full standalone timer via the
              <strong>Timer</strong> tab at any time.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
            <h4>5. Manage Your Data</h4>
            <p>
              Use the <strong>Export</strong> button to download your entire
              workout history and library as a JSON backup file. Use
              <strong>Import</strong> to restore data from a previous export or
              sync your progress between devices. Need a clean slate? The
              <strong>Delete All</strong> button (in red) permanently wipes all
              data after a confirmation prompt.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Install as an App (Mobile)</h3>
          <p>
            Workout Tracker is a Progressive Web App (PWA), meaning you can
            install it directly on your phone for a native app experience:
          </p>

            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Why Choose Workout Tracker?</h3>
          <p>
            Most fitness apps today are bloated with social features, require
            expensive subscriptions, and harvest your personal data. Workout
            Tracker is different:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>• 100% Free:</strong> No hidden fees or "premium" features.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>• No Data Collection:</strong> I don't even have a server to
            send your data to. It's yours, and it stays with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>• Lightweight:</strong> Built with vanilla JavaScript for
            maximum speed and minimal battery drain.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>• Ownership:</strong> Easily export your data to JSON
            anytime for your own records or analysis. Or delete it all with one
            tap.
          </p>

          <h3>Open Source</h3>
          <p>
            Workout Tracker is an open-source project. I believe in transparency
            and community-driven development.
