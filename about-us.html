          <h2>About Workout Tracker</h2>

          <p>
            Workout Tracker is a minimalist, privacy-focused fitness application
            designed for individuals who want to take control of their strength
            training journey without compromising their personal data.
          </p>

          <h3>Why I Built This</h3>
          <p>
            Honestly? Frustration. I looked around at the available workout
            tracking apps and kept running into the same problems — bloated
            interfaces, paywalls for basic features, mandatory accounts, and
            apps that felt like they were designed to sell you something rather
            than help you train.
          </p>
          <p>
            All I wanted was something free, simple, and straight to the point.
            Something I could open, log my workout, and close. No distractions,
            no subscriptions, no data being harvested. Since that app didn't
            seem to exist, I built it myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            And once it was working well for me, I thought — why not share it
            with the world? So here it is. Enjoy!
          </p>

          <h3>How to Use</h3>
          <p>
            Getting started with Workout Tracker is simple. Follow these steps
            to begin tracking your fitness journey:
          </p>

          <div class="feature-card" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
            <h4>1. Build Your Exercise Library</h4>
            <p>
              Start by going to the <strong>Library</strong> tab and clicking
              <strong>"New Exercise"</strong>. Add your favorite exercises with
              optional notes for form cues, equipment settings, or personal
              bests. You can also add <strong>tags</strong> to your exercises to
              easily filter and organize them by muscle group or equipment.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
            <h4>2. Create Workout Presets</h4>
            <p>
              Navigate to the <strong>Presets</strong> tab and click
              <strong>"New Preset"</strong>. Select exercises from your library
              and give your routine a name (e.g., "Push Day", "Leg Day", "Upper
              Body"). Presets make it quick and easy to start tracking your
              regular workout routines with a single click.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
            <h4>3. Track Your Workouts</h4>
            <p>
              Go to the <strong>Workouts</strong> tab and click
              <strong>"Track Workout"</strong>. Select a preset or create a
              custom workout. You can log each set with weight and reps, and
              classify them as
              <strong>warm-up (W), normal (N), or failure (F)</strong>. You can
              also track <strong>cardio</strong> sessions with duration and
              type.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
            <h4>4. Use the Rest Timer</h4>
            <p>
              Switch to the <strong>Timer</strong> tab during your workout. Use
              quick-set intervals (30s, 1m, 1m 30s, 2m, 3m) or enter a custom
              duration. The timer helps you maintain consistent rest periods,
              which is crucial for progressive overload and recovery.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
            <h4>5. Manage Your Data</h4>
            <p>
              Use the <strong>Export</strong> button to download your entire
              workout history and library as a JSON backup file. Use
              <strong>Import</strong> to restore data from a previous export or
              sync your progress between different devices.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Install as an App (Mobile)</h3>
          <p>
            Workout Tracker is a Progressive Web App (PWA), meaning you can
            install it directly on your phone for a native app experience:
          </p>

          <h3>Why Choose Workout Tracker?</h3>
          <p>
            Most fitness apps today are bloated with social features, require
            expensive subscriptions, and harvest your personal data. Workout
            Tracker is different:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>• 100% Free:</strong> No hidden fees or "premium" features.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>• No Data Collection:</strong> I don't even have a server to
            send your data to. It's yours, and it stays with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>• Lightweight:</strong> Built with vanilla JavaScript for
            maximum speed and minimal battery drain.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>• Ownership:</strong> Easily export your data to JSON
            anytime for your own records or analysis.
          </p>

          <h3>Open Source</h3>
          <p>
            Workout Tracker is an open-source project. I believe in transparency
            and community-driven development.
